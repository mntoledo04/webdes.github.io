		<p id="one">Myiopsitta monachus, also known as quaker parrots and monk parakeets originate in southern South America. In the highlands of Bolivia, then from eastern Bolivia, through southern Brazil to central Argentina. Not long ago Quakers were exported from Argentina in huge numbers. Many of these extremely sociable wild-caught birds were highly distressed at being separated from others of their kind. They were very noisy, calling for contact, thus Quakers gained a poor reputation. Today all young birds available are captive-bred. In the USA Quakers are popular and almost all young are hand-reared for the pet trade.</p>

		<p id="two">Quakers acquired when young can make delightful pets. They are extremely intelligent and have the potential to be very affectionate, playful and friendly. They can also become superb mimics and hand-reared birds have been known to start talking even before they are weaned. Because Quakers are so intelligent they resemble Grey Parrots in their ability to manipulate humans. It is therefore essential to teach and reinforce simple tasks such as “Step up!”</p>

<p id="three">These Quakers readily accept a varied diet that should comprise about 60% seed, dry and soaked or sprouted, and 40% fresh fruits, berries and vegetables.A good proportion of the diet can consist of wild foods such as hawthorn berries, blackberries, willow catkins, young leaves of dandelion and smooth sow thistle, and cultivated foods such as cotoneaster berries, flowers such as nasturtium, plus of course, the usual fruits including pomegranate, also soaked dried figs.</p>
