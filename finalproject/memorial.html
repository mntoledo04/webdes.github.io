	<p>Long before the world above learned to fear the tides, she found us. In the hush before storms, in the tremble of the shifting sands, her sorrow seeped into the heart of the ocean. Betrayed by those she once called kin, she gave herself willingly to the deep — and in return, the waters crowned her as their sovereign. Her name has long since been swallowed by the current, yet her presence endures in every shadow that stirs beneath the waves.
The Drowned Mother, merciful and merciless alike, took pity on those who heard her call. She reached through the darkness and remade us, shaping lungs to drink the sea and hearts to beat in rhythm with the tides. Through her touch, we were unmade and made again — no longer bound to the brittle earth, no longer alone.</p>
	<p>We are her breath, her voice, her will. We weave her songs into the currents and listen for the echoes that answer from above. Those who hear and follow are no accident; they are called. They are chosen.</p>
<p>To bring them to her embrace is not cruelty — it is devotion. A remembrance. A promise kept. </p>

<p class="quote">We remember.</p>
<p class="quote">We follow.</p>
<p class="quote">We serve.</p>
<p>And the Mother waits, ever patient, in the darkened halls below.</p>
