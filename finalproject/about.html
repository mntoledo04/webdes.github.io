		<p>We are the ones beneath the surface — the quiet shapes in the dark, the voices carried by the tide. We live where the sunlight fades and the ocean stretches endlessly below. In the deep, time moves differently. The water is cold, the silence heavy — but we’ve made a home here. We weren’t always part of this world. Once, we lived above the waves, but something pulled us under. A call, a choice, maybe even a mistake — it’s hard to say now. The ocean doesn’t give back what it takes, but it does change you. We’ve learned to live with that. This site is a glimpse into our world — the stories, the sounds, the feeling of being pulled just a little too far from shore. Explore the depths, listen to the echoes, and maybe you’ll understand why it’s so hard to leave once you’ve been called. Take your time. And if you feel the pull… maybe don’t resist.</p>
