		<p>Welcome humans! We've been waiting for you. Do you hear it? That soft, haunting melody weaving through the waves, calling your name? You've followed it this far — beneath the crashing tides and into the shadowy depths. Don’t be afraid. We’ve lured you here for a reason. The ocean holds secrets older than time, whispered through salt and silence. Here, beneath the surface, the line between beauty and danger blurs. We are the voices you’ve heard in your dreams, the glinting eyes beneath the moonlit waves. Some call us sirens, others call us monsters — but you… you may call us home. Stay a while. Let the current pull you deeper. </p>
		<p>We are the ones beneath the surface — the quiet shapes in the dark, the voices carried by the tide. We live where the sunlight fades and the ocean stretches endlessly below. In the deep, time moves differently. The water is cold, the silence heavy — but we’ve made a home here. We weren’t always part of this world. Once, we lived above the waves, but something pulled us under. A call, a choice, maybe even a mistake — it’s hard to say now. The ocean doesn’t give back what it takes, but it does change you. We’ve learned to live with that. This site is a glimpse into our world — the stories, the sounds, the feeling of being pulled just a little too far from shore. Explore the depths, listen to the echoes, and maybe you’ll understand why it’s so hard to leave once you’ve been called. Take your time. And if you feel the pull… maybe don’t resist. </p>
