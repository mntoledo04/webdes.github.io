	<h1>It’s Time to Stop Ignoring CDs and Give Them the Respect They Deserve</h1>

	<p><b>Making my case for starting a CD collection in 2024.</b></p>

<p>Everyone seems to prefer streaming for the convenience, while vinyl has become a niche favorite despite its heftier price tag. Meanwhile, CDs have been pushed to the sidelines.

But, in reality, they offer the best of both worlds. So why are they still forgotten?

Hear me out: Maybe now is the time to give this underrated format the respect it deserves.</p>

<p><b>The Rise and Fall of CDs</b></p>

<p>Before CDs or streaming took over, we relied on vinyl records and cassette tapes. Vinyl sounded nice but wasn’t practical (and, as someone who had to lug around a crate of records when moving, I should know). Cassettes, on the other hand, weren’t as bulky but came with lower sound quality. So, when CDs entered the market, they changed everything. They offered clearer sound, more storage, and were easier to handle. No more surface noise, just clean sound, longer playing time, and instant track access. What’s not to love?
But, like any new tech, the industry didn’t exactly roll out the red carpet for CDs.
Many resisted the format switch initially.
It took artists like Stevie Wonder to help usher CDs into the spotlight. And, by 1987, CDs had outpaced vinyl sales. The format’s popularity soared, reaching its peak in 2000 when a staggering 730 million CDs were sold in the US alone. Remember NSYNC’s “No Strings Attached”? It was one of the many albums that sold millions of copies during this CD golden age.</p>

<p>Then came the digital revolution.
MP3s and platforms like Napster emerged, and CDs began to lose their place. Then, streaming took over in the 2010s, causing CD sales to nosedive.
By 2020, U.S. CD album sales had plummeted to just 40 million—the lowest in 35 years.
But CDs didn’t die entirely. In fact, they have been staging a quiet comeback since 2021.
Back then, CD sales in the US rose for the first time in almost two decades.
Fast forward to 2024, and CDs are outselling digital downloads by a 3 to 1 margin.
People are finally starting to realize that CDs still have a lot to offer. For good reason.
But, it’s still very far from the current rise of vinyl.
While interest in CDs is rekindling, they’re not exactly flying off the shelves like hotcakes. Most people still prefer vinyl for physical media and nostalgia or stick with the convenience of streaming. It’s still nowhere near the popularity it had before.</p>

<p><b>CD vs. Vinyl</b></p>

<p>Vinyl is trendy, but is it better than CDs? Not really. Vinyl records have limitations. Sound engineers often have to adjust the music to fit the format, sometimes cutting out high or low frequencies to avoid distortion. This is why vinyl has that “warm” sound—it’s the result of its physical limitations.
CDs don’t have these problems. They capture a broader range of sounds, giving listeners a more accurate version of the music.
For example, CDs sample music at a rate of 44.1 kHz, capturing frequencies as high as 20 kHz—the upper limit of what the human ear can detect. Vinyl simply can’t compete with that level of detail.If you’re not much into hi-res listening or don’t think you’ll hear the difference anyway, then consider the practicality. And, CDs still win in that aspect.

CDs are generally more durable for frequent listening, as they don’t suffer from the physical wear that occurs when a needle runs through a vinyl groove. This makes CDs a more practical choice for everyday use, while still offering impressive potential longevity when properly cared for.

Don’t get me wrong—I love vinyl for the experience. After a long day, there’s nothing quite like pouring a glass of prosecco and unwinding with a record. To keep it short, it generally makes me feel *posh*.

Yet, I’ve never really felt like the sound quality is to die for. While vinyl may have a nostalgic appeal, CDs provide a more faithful listening experience.</p>

<p><b>CD vs. Streaming</b></p>


<p>Streaming is super convenient, but it lacks something important—physical ownership.

With a CD, the music is yours. You don’t have to worry about a song disappearing from your playlist because of a licensing issue. Imagine your favorite artist suddenly deciding to remove their catalog from your streaming service of choice or, even worse, from all music services. What then? And, if you’re more into being able to play songs anywhere, CDs have you covered. You can easily rip them and store digital files, giving you the best of both worlds.

Streaming services may have improved sound quality, with a lot of platforms offering lossless audio. But, at least based on my experience, these are not that dependent.

The sound quality tends to change a lot depending on your internet connection, or even some software bugs.

On the other hand, CDs offer a consistent and reliable sound. Oh, and there’s something special about flipping through album art and liner notes streaming just can’t match.</p>

<p><b>A Case for CD Respect</b></p>

<p>CDs deserve a second chance. They are a perfect mix of vinyl’s physical appeal and streaming’s convenience.

CDs are affordable, easy to store, and sound great. They’re also becoming popular again, especially with Gen Z, who are discovering the fun of owning music physically. With more people rediscovering CDs, it’s clear that they’re not just a relic of the past. Quite the opposite. CDs offer real value.

So before you toss out your old collection, think twice. There’s still life left in those discs, and they might just be the perfect way to enjoy your music.

Or, why not start collecting CDs right now? That way, you always have your favorite tunes at your fingertips, without having to rely on an internet connection to enjoy them. Unplugging is good for the soul, I hear. And, with a soothing soundtrack, it’s downright pleasant.</p>

	<h2>Why I think CD's Are Still Cool</h2>
	<p>I completely agree with the article "It's Time to Stop Ignoring CDs and Give Them the Respect They Deserve." CDs are one of the most underrated music formats, and it’s great to see them finally getting some recognition</p>

<p>One of the best things about CDs is that they encourage listeners to experience an entire album the way the artist intended. Unlike streaming, where it’s easy to skip around or only listen to singles, a CD pushes you to enjoy the full body of work. This makes listening to music a more immersive experience. For example, in the "Selfish Machines" album by Pierce the Veil, the songs "Southern Constellations" and "The Boy Who Could Fly" connect, which is something I would not have noticed if I just hit shuffle on Spotify.</p>

<p>Another huge reason I collect CDs is the album art. Seeing the cover, the booklet, and any extras included in the case adds another layer to the experience. It’s so much easier to appreciate an album’s design when you can hold it in your hands rather than just seeing a small thumbnail on a phone screen. For collectors, CDs are amazing because they’re physical pieces of music. You can display them, flip through them, and even carry them around.

Personally, my favorite place to use CDs is in my car. There’s something nostalgic and satisfying about popping a CD into the player, especially on a long drive. No ads, no buffering—just music.</p>

<p>CDs deserve more love, and I hope more people start to recognize just how great they are. Whether for the sound quality, the collectible aspect, or just the joy of holding an album in your hands, CDs still have a place in today’s music world.</p>
