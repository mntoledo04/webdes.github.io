	<p>Hi! My name is Mehida Toledo!</p>

	<p>I am a 21 year old college student majoring in Graphic Design and minoring in Design Management. I have a lovely boyfriend, a bird named Patty, and a drive to create cool stuff. I have been drawing ever since I could pick up a crayon and I've loved doing it. I also tend to indulge in other creative hobbies like sewing, crochet, baking, painting, jewlery making, and ceramics.</p>
	
	<p>I'm making this website for my Website Design class, which I was reluctant to take but I'm actually loving it. I hated the thought of coding but I'm having fun so far. I want to keep learning graphic design to be able to freelance and help small businesses. I also want to go into school for baking and make cakes for events and birthdays on the side. I don't have huge plans for the future so I just go with the flow and enjoying the process.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading a little bit about me!</p>
